# LEDGER-PIVOT-SEARCH

Search memo. Target: a replacement ledger for the counting-apparatus
compute-cost ambition that is sensitive to cyclotomic depth rather than
residue-class parity. Opened because [memos/COUNTING-APPARATUS.md](memos/COUNTING-APPARATUS.md) §(D)
records that length-of-`M_N`, the current candidate ledger, factors through
an invariant that does not track `φ(n)/2`. This memo sits downstream of
`COUNTING-APPARATUS`: if a candidate passes here, it hands off to §(A)/(B);
if no candidate passes, the branch closes negative with an explicit
impossibility.

Register: search memo, append-only during active life, provisional.

## Driving impossibility (working form, not proved)

The compression `(n, k, x_{n,k}) → M_N → |M_N|` is a two-stage quotient. The
first stage keeps collision multiplicities at equal x-values, discarding the
x-values themselves. The second keeps only the length (count of occupied
x-cells), discarding the multiplicity sequence. The load-bearing step is the
first: any two sweep inputs with the same collision pattern yield identical
`M_N`, hence identical `|M_N|`.

The working impossibility: a hypothetical "generic rational placeholder"
sweep — x-values chosen to be arbitrary rationals matching the real sweep's
collision pattern exactly — has no cyclotomic depth but the same `|M_N|`.
Therefore any cost measure that factors through `|M_N|` cannot lower-bound
tasks whose difficulty is cyclotomic-depth-controlled.

The placeholder construction is not yet shown to exist for every collision
pattern. Some real-sweep collisions may be forced by algebraic coincidence
in a way that resists rational stand-ins. Working assumption: the
impossibility holds modulo that construction question, and the live search
is what ledger avoids the quotient.

**Strengthened form (algebraic placeholders).** A generalization, surfaced
during candidate #3's stress-test: instead of rational stand-ins, use
algebraic-of-same-degree stand-ins. For each occupied x-cell of degree
`d`, replace its x-value by a fresh algebraic number of degree `d` that
is not a Galois conjugate of the original. The collision pattern, the
degree multiset, and even per-cell algebraicity are preserved; cyclotomic
provenance, real embedding, and incidence structure are not. Any ledger
that factors through `(collision pattern, degree multiset)` therefore
inherits the impossibility — including degree-only forms of value-
structure (item #3 in its naive form) and degree-blind Galois-orbit
counts (item #4 if not refined). The placeholder attack is parameterized
by lattice coordinate; see §"Ledger lattice" below for the
domination-and-defeat conditions.

**Scalar-summary failure pattern.** `|M_N|` itself was the program's
first encounter with a more general failure pattern, surfaced during
candidate #4's stress-test: any ledger that takes scalar count of
equivalence classes after a structural quotient inherits the driving
impossibility by construction, regardless of which parent quotient
produced the count. Bare Galois-orbit count (item #4 in its naive form)
sits at the same `(P0, A0)` lattice coordinate as `|M_N|`, just from a
different parent quotient. The pattern is predictive: future candidates
that factor through "count of X-equivalence classes" are flagged a
priori. See §"Ledger lattice" for inhabitants by coordinate and what
structural content has to survive each placeholder attack.

## First exhibit: closed-form Δ|M_n|

Verified empirically at [n-gons/counting/verify_increment_formula.py](n-gons/counting/verify_increment_formula.py),
n = 3 through 40. The script reports two MISS rows at n = 4 and n = 6,
which are the non-trivial Niven zeros (`τ(4) = τ(6) = 0`,
crystallographic restriction); the closed form below holds for all
other tested n:

    odd n:         Δ|M_n| = (n - 1)/2
    n ≡ 0 mod 4:   Δ|M_n| = (n - 4)/2      [n = 4 boundary: actual +1]
    n ≡ 2 mod 4:   Δ|M_n| = (n - 6)/2      [n = 6 boundary: actual +1]

The recurrence is clean from n = 7 onward in all three residue classes.

The formula is governed by `n mod 4` alone — not by `φ(n)/2`. The two agree
numerically on odd primes, since `(p-1)/2 = φ(p)/2`; the fracture is visible
on composites and prime powers:

| `n`  | class      | `φ(n)/2` | `Δ|M_n|` | fracture |
|-----:|:-----------|---------:|---------:|---------:|
|    5 | prime      | 2        | 2        | 0        |
|    7 | prime      | 3        | 3        | 0        |
|    9 | prime²     | 3        | 4        | +1       |
|   11 | prime      | 5        | 5        | 0        |
|   15 | composite  | 4        | 7        | +3       |
|   21 | composite  | 6        | 10       | +4       |
|   25 | prime²     | 10       | 12       | +2       |
|   27 | prime³     | 9        | 13       | +4       |
|   33 | composite  | 10       | 16       | +6       |

Length-of-`M_N` grows linearly in `n` within each residue class; `φ(n)/2`
grows with irregular factor structure. The agreement on odd primes is the
reason the naive "length tracks algebraic depth" reading looked plausible
longer than it should have. The fracture column is the receipt.

## Second exhibit: ψ fracture

Verified at [n-gons/counting/verify_psi_fracture.py](n-gons/counting/verify_psi_fracture.py),
default range `n = 3` through `60`.

The ψ-pivot repairs the `n = 7` miss because ψ is sensitive to prime-power
content. But ψ is additive on prime-power parts, while the trace-field degree
`φ(n)/2` inherits φ's multiplicative cross-prime coupling. Equal-ψ classes can
therefore hide different trace degrees.

Named equal-ψ / different-degree pairs:

| rows | ψ | trace degrees `φ(n)/2` | spread |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `7`, `15` | 6 | `3`, `4` | 1 |
| `11`, `35` | 10 | `5`, `12` | 7 |
| `16`, `40` | 8 | `4`, `8` | 4 |

Largest nonzero spreads through `n = 60`:

| ψ | rows as `n:φ(n)/2` | spread |
|---:|:---|---:|
| 20 | `25:10`, `50:10`, `57:18` | 8 |
| 14 | `39:12`, `52:12`, `55:20` | 8 |
| 18 | `19:9`, `27:9`, `38:9`, `51:16`, `54:9` | 7 |
| 10 | `11:5`, `22:5`, `35:12`, `45:12`, `48:8`, `56:12` | 7 |
| 12 | `13:6`, `26:6`, `33:10`, `44:10` | 4 |

So the row ψ ledger localizes the first planar crystallographic break, but it
does not preserve the trace-field degree. It quotients the problem through
"minimum crystallographic ambient rank" rather than through "native 2D trace
field."

## Support-level resolution of candidate #1

The phrase "ψ-stratified sweep-x-support" hides three different ledgers:

- **L1: row ψ ledger.** The sequence `(ψ(n))_{3 <= n <= N}`. This is a
  function of the row label alone. It sees no x-values.
- **L2: ψ-stratum support counts.** The number of support points `(n, k)` in
  each ψ stratum. This keeps row weights but not the actual x-values.
- **L3: exact support with ψ grading.** The full set `{(x_{n,k}, ψ(n))}`.
  This keeps the values themselves.

The verification script runs a rational-placeholder relabeling at `N = 15`:
each occupied x-cell is assigned a fresh rational placeholder while preserving
the collision partition. Output:

```text
occupied x-cells: 43
total support points (n,k): 117
collision signature preserved: True
L2 psi support counts unchanged: True
L3 exact support with psi grading changed: True
L2 counts by psi: 2:13, 4:35, 6:45, 10:11, 12:13
```

This is the support-level version of the driving impossibility. L1 is omitted
from the output because it ignores x-values by definition — it is trivially
invariant under any relabeling, including the placeholder. L2 is the
non-trivial invariance: rational placeholder values preserve the `(n, k)`
membership of each ψ stratum, so the stratum counts are unchanged even
though the cyclotomic content is gone. L3 escapes only because it retains
the x-values. But then ψ is a grading on a value-structured ledger; the
load-bearing invariant is the minimal-polynomial / Galois-orbit content of
the x-values, which points to candidates (3) and (4), not to ψ alone.

## Sensitivity criterion (intake filter)

A candidate ledger `L_N` passes the filter iff there exist two relabelings
of the sweep x-values — both preserving the collision pattern — that `L_N`
distinguishes. Length fails this trivially. More ambitiously, `L_N` should
be non-invariant under any relabeling that preserves `n mod 4` but changes
prime factorization.

## Items under search

Candidate replacement ledgers, ordered from closest-to-hand to
furthest-afield:

1. **ψ-stratified sweep-x-support.** ψ-classes of corner x-positions; ψ is
   additive on prime-power parts, so a ψ-stratified count retains the
   prime-factorization content that length discards. Already localizes the
   n=7 break in the existing repo figure.
   Anchor: [n-gons/counting/PSI-STRATIFICATION.md](n-gons/counting/PSI-STRATIFICATION.md).
   Update: this candidate resolves into L1 (row ψ) and L2 (ψ-stratum
   support counts), which inherit the driving impossibility by the ψ-fracture
   and placeholder tests above, and L3 (exact support with ψ grading), which
   survives sensitivity only by reducing to value-structure / Galois-orbit
   ledgers. ψ remains load-bearing only under the crystallographic-realization
   path in §"Compute-model / ledger coupling."

2. **Row-field-degree tally.** For each row n, the degree
   `[ℚ(cos(2π/n)) : ℚ] = φ(n)/2`. Sum, max, or weighted aggregate over
   `n ∈ [3, N]`. Directly arithmetic; may be too coarse (no position
   content).
   Update: located at `(P1, A1)` in the lattice. Gives a coarse,
   non-vacuous primitive-op lower bound on T1 and T3 via the
   row-entry argument — producing any row-n value forces entering
   `ℚ(cos(2π/n))`, so total work is at least `max_{n ≤ N} φ(n)/2` (the
   additive `Σ φ(n)/2` form is conservative; composita and field
   reuse make the sum hard to warrant without independence
   assumptions). Not matching/tight (no per-cell precision or
   root-isolation cost), but valid as a below-matching companion to
   `V_cert`.

3. **Value-structure at distinct x-cells.** For each occupied x-cell,
   record the minimal polynomial of the x-value over `ℚ`, an isolating
   interval / real-embedding index distinguishing Galois conjugates, the
   collision-cell incidence, and contributing `(n, k)` provenance.
   Update: degree-only and min-poly-only variants collapse — the
   algebraic-placeholder attack at matching degree multiset preserves
   the former, and distinct elements of the same trace field can share
   a parent min-poly while occupying distinct sweep positions (the
   structural pattern: `cos(π/7)`, `cos(3π/7)`, `cos(5π/7)` are
   Galois conjugates over `ℚ` with shared minimal polynomial
   `8x³ − 4x² − 4x + 1`, illustrating the form of conjugate-collapse
   the min-poly-only ledger inherits; sweep x-cells exhibit related
   collapses with their own min-polys, verified per-cell by Sage).
   Surviving form is `V_cert(N) = Σ_{cells C} (deg(P_C) + height(P_C)
   + root-isolation cost)` at lattice coordinate `(P3, A2)`, dominating
   `F2` and incomparable with `O_cert` — see §"Ledger lattice" below.

4. **Galois-orbit count.** Total count of Galois orbits of sweep x-values
   up to `n = N`. Invariant of the Galois action on the sweep, independent
   of cell-occupation combinatorics.
   Update: bare count sits at lattice coordinate `(P0, A0)` — same
   point as `|M_N|`, just from a different parent quotient (see
   §"Ledger lattice") — and inherits the strengthened impossibility by
   construction. The orbit-level placeholder replaces each Galois orbit
   `O_i` with a fresh algebraic conjugacy class of matching size from a
   different totally real field, preserving orbit count, sizes, and
   membership while changing field/conductor, min-polys, and heights.
   Surviving form is `O_cert(N) = Σ_orbits (field/conductor + P_O /
   height(P_O) + stabilizer + incidence-map costs)` at lattice
   coordinate `(orbit, A3)`. Incomparable with `V_cert` in the lattice
   (orbit-positional and cell-positional are different quotients,
   neither dominating the other); the comparison resolves only by task
   choice — orbit-level tasks pick `O_cert`, ordered-real-sweep tasks
   pick `V_cert` (per-cell root-isolation forces cell-positional
   granularity).

5. **Six-field decomposition as weighted ledger.** [n-gons/counting/COUNTING.md](n-gons/counting/COUNTING.md)
   §backbone identifies six fields governing word shape. A ledger
   weighted by field content (rather than flat word length) may recover
   cyclotomic sensitivity within the existing apparatus.
   Update: candidate splits into four variants under stress-test. F0
   (six-field counts only) and F1 (counts weighted by `φ(n)/2` or
   `ψ(n)`) are multidimensional scalar-summary variants — both inherit
   the working impossibility (per §"Driving impossibility") for
   cyclotomic-content tasks. F3 (full value-certified ledger per
   field) collapses onto `V_cert` at `(P3, A2)`, decorated with
   redundant field labels. F2 (six-field incidence ledger
   `(field, n, k → cell)`) is the genuine survivor at lattice
   coordinate `(P2, A0)` (see §"Ledger lattice"), incomparable with
   row-field-degree along the product order. F2's survival is
   task-coupled: dominates the typed-incidence-production task point
   `(P2, A0)` and serves as a cost ledger there; for any task
   demanding `A2` or higher, F2 fails and must promote to `V_cert`.
   Caveat: per [n-gons/counting/COUNTING.md](n-gons/counting/COUNTING.md), the six-field
   decomposition is verified through `N = 25` and conjectural beyond;
   F2's general applicability inherits this verification status.

6. **Champernowne-encoding height.** [n-gons/counting/PSEUDO-CHAMPERNOWNE.md](n-gons/counting/PSEUDO-CHAMPERNOWNE.md)
   connects `M_N` to a Champernowne-style encoding. Height of the encoded
   number may be a finer invariant than length.

## Ledger lattice

The items above do not order on a single chain. They occupy points in a
partial order along two axes — positional / incidence granularity and
depth of algebraic certification — with domination given by the product
order: ledger A dominates ledger B iff A retains at least as much
positional content as B *and* at least as much algebraic certification
as B. Where one has more on one axis and less on the other, the two
are incomparable; an earlier "structural tiers" chain framing forced
arbitrary tiebreaks that the lattice dissolves.

**The lattice has two coupled readings; keep them distinct.**

- **Semantic lattice.** What information the ledger retains. The
  `(P, A)` coordinates below describe this lattice: which positional
  structure and which algebraic certification the ledger preserves.
  Well-defined per ledger.
- **Cost lattice under a compute model `M`.** What `M` forces a
  process to pay for. This is what matters for primitive-op lower
  bounds. Under *certification-preserving* models — algebraic-
  arithmetic over `ℚ` with paid adjunctions and bounded constants,
  ASLP with charged field extensions, bounded-coefficient linear
  circuits — the projection from semantic to cost is *intended* to be
  near identity (this is the hypothesis class the program is
  committing to, pending the primitive-op cost theorem named in
  §"Lower bounds, domination, and matching"), and under that
  hypothesis the `(P, A)` coordinates carry their cost meaning intact.
  Under *unbounded-linear* models — where free unbounded linear
  combinations are admitted — the projection collapses much of the
  A-axis, because algebraic depth can be moved into coefficients,
  basis changes, or precomputed linear maps (the FFT mult-to-add
  conversion is the canonical mechanism; see Hazard 2 of
  [memos/FFT-CYCLOTOMIC-COMPLEXITY.md](memos/FFT-CYCLOTOMIC-COMPLEXITY.md)).

The lattice described below is the semantic lattice. When the memo
speaks of "matching" and "cost," it is implicitly fixing a
certification-preserving model under which the projection is
hypothesized to hold; the projection is itself the open theorem the
bridge wants. Outside that regime the matching language demotes; see
§"Matching is model-indexed" further down.

**P-axis (positional / incidence granularity).**

- `P0` — scalar summary. Count of equivalence classes after a quotient.
- `P1` — row-indexed. One value per row `n`, no per-corner content.
- `P2` — typed field-incidence. Per-cell with structural typing and
  row provenance `(n, k → cell)`.
- `P3` — exact cell / ordered embedding. Per-cell with full positional
  identity on the real line.

A separate orbit-positional dimension groups cells by Galois orbit.
Orbits are not a refinement of cells — they are a different quotient on
cells — so orbit-positional sits orthogonal to the `P0`–`P3` chain.

**A-axis (algebraic certification depth).**

- `A0` — none / structural typing only.
- `A1` — row-field degree, the abstract `[ℚ(cos(2π/n)) : ℚ] = φ(n)/2`.
- `A2` — value certificate per cell: minimal polynomial + height +
  isolating interval.
- `A3` — orbit certificate: field/conductor + Galois action /
  stabilizer + incidence map into the orbit.

**Inhabitants by coordinate.**

- `|M_N|` at `(P0, A0)`. Scalar count, no algebraic content. Bottom of
  every chain through the lattice.
- Item #4 in its naive form (bare orbit count) at `(P0, A0)` — same
  coordinate as `|M_N|`, just a different parent quotient.
- Item #2 (row-field-degree tally) at `(P1, A1)`. Per-row algebraic
  depth, no positional incidence.
- Item #5 surviving form (`F2`) at `(P2, A0)`. Typed positional
  incidence with row provenance, no algebraic certification.
- Item #3 surviving form (`V_cert`) at `(P3, A2)`. Exact ordered cell
  values with embedding certificates.
- Item #4 surviving form (`O_cert`) at `(orbit, A3)`. Orbit-positional
  granularity with full orbit certificate.

**Domination tests.**

- `V_cert` dominates `F2` (`P3 > P2`, `A2 > A0`).
- `V_cert` dominates row-field-degree (`P3 > P1`, `A2 > A1`).
- `F2` and row-field-degree are incomparable: `F2` has more `P`, less
  `A`; row-field-degree has more `A`, less `P`. Each can be
  placeholder-attacked along the axis it does not see.
- `V_cert` and `O_cert` are incomparable on the positional axis
  (cell-positional vs orbit-positional are different quotients,
  neither refining the other). The comparison resolves only when a
  task fixes the positional axis it requires.
- `|M_N|` is dominated by every other inhabitant.

**Predictive principle (generalized).** A task demands a lattice
coordinate `(P_t, A_t)`. Passing ledgers are those that dominate
`(P_t, A_t)` in the product order. Any ledger not dominating the
demanded point fails: the placeholder attack at the missing axis
defeats it. The earlier "scalar-summary tier inherits impossibility a
priori" is the special case where any non-trivial cyclotomic-content
task demands strictly more than `(P0, A0)`, so any `(P0, A0)` ledger
fails by construction. The lattice gives the full version:
non-domination on either axis is sufficient for failure.

**Task-literal output vs model-induced internal demand.** When the
lattice writes "task `T` demands `(P_t, A_t)`," that is a derived
statement, not a primitive. The task itself has *output semantics*:
T1 asks for ordered real positions to precision `10⁻ᵏ`; T3 asks for
distinction at precision `ε`. Neither literally asks for min-poly,
height, or isolating interval. The lattice coordinate `(P_t, A_t)` is
what a *model* forces a process completing T to internalize: under
certification-preserving algebraic-arithmetic, computing real
positions to precision flows through min-poly / height /
isolating-interval data, so the model induces an A2 internal demand.
Under unbounded-linear, precomputed tables can give the same output
without those certificates; the model induces no A demand. The
"matching" judgement is therefore a model-relative theorem about what
the model forces on a process completing T, not a task-literal
property. The next theorem to prove is not "`V_cert` matches T1/T3"
but "in a precisely axiomatized certification-preserving model,
T1/T3 force `V_cert`-level internal work."

**Lower bounds, domination, and matching.** A ledger gives a
non-vacuous lower bound on a task when its accounting reflects
unavoidable work for any process completing the task. There are three
regimes relative to the task's matching coordinate `(P_t, A_t)`:

- **At matching.** The ledger's accounting tightly reflects the task's
  unavoidable work; the lower bound is matching / tight. Search
  target.
- **Below matching.** The ledger captures *some* unavoidable work but
  not all of it; the lower bound is non-vacuous but loose. Example:
  row-field-degree at `(P1, A1)` gives at least `max_{n ≤ N} φ(n)/2`
  as a coarse lower bound on T1 — any process producing a row-n value
  must enter `ℚ(cos(2π/n))`, so the work is at least the maximum
  row-field degree across rows touched. (The additive `Σ φ(n)/2` form
  is conservative under independence assumptions, but composita and
  field reuse make the sum harder to warrant without an additional
  argument.) Real bound, but doesn't reflect per-cell precision or
  root-isolation cost.
- **Above matching.** The ledger captures work the task doesn't
  strictly require; the bound it produces is a lower bound on a
  *stronger* task (one that needs the ledger's full content), not on
  the original task. Example: `V_cert` dominates T2's matching
  coordinate in the lattice but cannot lower-bound T2 — T2's
  combinatorial output does not require V_cert's algebraic content;
  T2's matching ledger is `F2`.

Matching ledgers are the search target. Below-matching ledgers exist
as fallback / coarse companion bounds. Above-matching ledgers are
pointing at a different (stronger) task, not at T itself.

**Matching is a structural prediction, not yet a proven matching.**
The lattice apparatus organizes domination structurally; the
"matching" judgement at any specific `(P_t, A_t)` rests on two further
claims that are not themselves established here: (a) the strengthened
driving impossibility (currently *working form, not proved*), which
the placeholder attack at the missing axis depends on, and (b) a
primitive-op cost theorem connecting the ledger's components (e.g.,
min-poly degree, height, root-isolation cost in `V_cert`) to actual
primitive-operation count in the chosen compute model. The memo's
matching language presumes both; neither is yet in hand. "Matching"
should be read as best-current-candidate-for-matching pending those
two pieces.

**Matching is also model-indexed.** Beyond (a) and (b), the matching
claim presumes (c) the cost-lattice projection from the semantic
lattice is near identity — i.e., the chosen compute model preserves
A-axis distinctions as cost distinctions. Under certification-
preserving algebraic-arithmetic over `ℚ` (paid adjunctions, bounded
constants, no free unbounded linear combinations) this presumption
holds. Under unbounded-linear models, A-axis distinctions can collapse
via mult-to-add conversion, and the matching claim demotes from
"`V_cert` is tight for T1/T3" to "`V_cert` is above-task; the task
needs strengthening to demand certificates, or the model needs an
explicit boundedness constraint." The committable triple T1/T3 +
`V_cert` + algebraic-arithmetic is matching only under the
certification-preserving reading of algebraic-arithmetic. Under
unbounded-linear readings the surviving lower-bound currencies are:
bounded-coefficient additions (Morgenstern-style determinant growth),
positional/incidence (`F2`), strengthened-task certificate production
(`V_cert` with the task changed), or Kraft-style uniform encoding.

**The lattice is a negative-space classifier, not a cost-model
certifier.** Two structural caveats follow. First, the product order
treats positional and algebraic content as independent axes, which is
optimistic: rational equivalence (per Hazard 5 of
[memos/FFT-CYCLOTOMIC-COMPLEXITY.md](memos/FFT-CYCLOTOMIC-COMPLEXITY.md))
can preserve algebraic certification while destroying per-cell
positional structure, so "incomparability" rulings between two ledgers
can reflect axis coupling rather than orthogonality, and should be
treated as provisional pending content-preservation checks on the
relevant transformations. Second, the lattice tells us where a
proposed ledger is probably forgetting too much — which placeholder
attack defeats it, which axis it sits below — but does not by itself
certify that a surviving ledger is a cost model. The matching
paragraph above names the two extra pieces required for that. Read
the lattice as a filter on failure modes, with positive certification
deferred to whatever proves the matching.

**Importing existing literature bounds requires structure-preservation
checks.** A multiplicative-complexity bound from the FFT-complexity
literature (e.g., Auslander–Feig–Winograd 1984 per
[memos/FFT-CYCLOTOMIC-COMPLEXITY.md](memos/FFT-CYCLOTOMIC-COMPLEXITY.md))
lives at a coarser grain than `V_cert` and rests on rational-equivalence
preservation — exactly the relation that can scramble per-cell
positional structure. Importing such a bound into `V_cert`-style
accounting requires either showing the reduction preserves the
`V_cert` positional content, or accepting that the bound applies only
modulo a positional quotient — coarse companion bound in the
below-matching regime, not tight matching. Same logic as the
row-field-degree case, with an external-import path.

**Coupling to compute-model / task choice.** The Path 1 / Path 2 split
becomes a choice of demanded lattice coordinate. Path 1
(crystallographic-realization) demands orbit-positional with an `A3`
certificate (`O_cert`-shaped). Path 2 (trace-computation under
*certification-preserving* algebraic-arithmetic over `ℚ` — paid
adjunctions, bounded constants) demands `(P3, A2)` (`V_cert`-shaped);
under unbounded-linear readings of algebraic-arithmetic the Path 2
matching collapses per §"Matching is model-indexed" above. `F2` sits
on a Path-1-flavored task track of its own — typed-incidence-
production demands `(P2, A0)`, which `F2` dominates, and that demand
is robust under unbounded-linear models because the *task's output
semantics* require explicit typed-incidence production, not because
the lattice protects positional content intrinsically. (Unbounded-
linear models do not naturally compute discrete incidence objects;
the robustness is from the task spec, not from the model regime.) The
same ledger can pass under one task and fail under another depending
on which lattice point the task demands and which model regime it
operates in.

**Item #6 (Champernowne height) location.** Not yet placed; a strong
candidate for `(P0, A0)`, in which case it inherits the impossibility
a priori. Worth stress-testing under that hypothesis.

## Compute-model / ledger coupling

Ledger choice is not independent of compute-model choice. There are now two
different paths, and they should not be collapsed. **Path 1** is a
crystallographic-realization task: ψ is the ledger, and the machine model is a
rank/lattice model that charges crystallographic realization. **Path 2** is a
trace-computation task: the ledger is value-structure, row-field degree, or
Galois orbit data, and the machine model is algebraic arithmetic over `Q` or an
algebraic straight-line program. Both are legitimate Landfall-parallel
ambitions; they would prove different theorems.

Under Path 1 the explicit ψ-ledgers are:

```text
Ψ_max(N) = max_{3 <= n <= N} ψ(n)
Ψ_sum(N) = sum_{3 <= n <= N} ψ(n)
Ψ_wit(N) = sum over charged witnesses (n,k) of ψ(n).
```

`Ψ_max` is the ambient lattice rank needed for one shared realization machine
handling every row through `N`; `Ψ_sum` is row-wise certificate capacity;
`Ψ_wit` is a witness-weighted aggregate for a distinguishing task.

These are capacity / certificate-size lower bounds before they are primitive-op
lower bounds. A Path 1 compute model must explicitly charge rank allocation,
integer-matrix construction, or certificate production as primitive operations
before a ψ-ledger becomes a Landfall-style compute-cost theorem. Under Path 2
the rank-allocation form of the caveat disappears (algebraic arithmetic
charges field adjunctions and ring operations natively), but a separate cost
theorem connecting `V_cert` components — minimum polynomial degree, height,
root-isolation cost — to primitive-operation count is still required. The
natural Path 2 ledgers are trace degree, minimum-polynomial degree, and
Galois-orbit structure, but their primitive-op tightness depends on that
pending theorem.

**`O_cert` is a sibling track, not a Path 1 sub-case.** Path 1 was originally
named for the crystallographic-realization task with ψ-ledger and rank/lattice
machine model. The `O_cert` ledger surfaced during candidate #4's stress-test
defines a *separate* non-trace-computation track — orbit-realization with
per-orbit field/poly/action/incidence certificates — with its own compute
model. Both Path 1 (ψ-rank) and the `O_cert` track are sibling alternatives
to Path 2 (V_cert + algebraic-arithmetic), but they are not the same ledger.
Earlier text that tagged `O_cert` as "Path 1" should be read as "Path-1-
flavored sibling track."

**Certification-preserving model: open axioms.** The qualifier
"certification-preserving algebraic-arithmetic over `ℚ`" used in the
Path 2 commitment, and propagated to `memos/COUNTING-APPARATUS.md`
§(A) and `README.md`, is currently informal. To make it precise the
following must be committed (each is a free parameter of the model):

1. Are arbitrary algebraic constants permitted as advice, or must
   they be constructed by paid adjunctions?
2. Are coefficients height-bounded, and if so, by what bound?
3. Are additions primitive and binary, or are arbitrary linear
   combinations also primitive?
4. Is a precomputed DFT-like matrix (or any precomputed linear
   transform) free or paid?
5. Are field adjunctions paid by degree, height, or both?
6. Is root isolation paid by precision, by certification depth, or
   both?
7. Is the model uniform in `N` (a single machine handles all inputs),
   or non-uniform (advice scales with `N`)?

Without commitments on all seven, "certification-preserving" is a
label for the desired conclusion rather than a model-theoretic regime.
The committable triple's matching claim depends on this axiomatization
being settled in the direction that preserves the A-axis as a cost
axis. The natural commitments inferred from program tradition (paid
adjunctions, bounded constants, binary additions, paid precomputed
linear transforms, paid adjunctions by degree, paid root isolation by
precision, uniform in `N`) are the working defaults; explicit
commitment is pending and is itself part of the bridge work.

**Partial settlement from Morgenstern 1973**
([memos/MORGENSTERN-1973-BRIEF.md](memos/MORGENSTERN-1973-BRIEF.md)):
the existing FFT-complexity literature's bounded-coefficient lower
bound settles axiom 2 in a *modulus-bounded* variant (rather than
algebraic-height-bounded), axiom 3 in *binary fan-in* form, and
answers axiom 1 in a too-permissive direction (arbitrary complex
coefficients of bounded modulus are free as advice, without paid
construction by adjunction). Axioms 4–7 remain open in Morgenstern's
setup. The literature's partial overlap with the program's
certification-preserving regime is therefore real but partial:
bounded-coefficient is the right *shape* of constraint, but the
program needs algebraic-height boundedness rather than modulus
boundedness, and needs paid algebraic-constant construction rather
than free bounded advice.

## Task-ledger admissibility

With the lattice in hand, each candidate task statement in
`memos/COUNTING-APPARATUS.md` §(B) admits a comparison against the
inhabited ledger points. Result of that comparison:

| Task | `V_cert` `(P3, A2)` | `O_cert` `(orbit, A3)` | `F2` `(P2, A0)` | row-deg `(P1, A1)` |
|------|:-------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------:|:------------------:|
| T1 (enumerate corner positions to `10⁻ᵏ`) | matching | no¹ | no values | coarse⁴ |
| T2 (compute `M_N`) | overkill² | no | matching³ | no word structure |
| T3 (distinguish round-trace pairs at `ε`) | matching | no¹ | no values | coarse⁴ |

¹ Only under reformulation to an orbit-level task; for real-line
distinction, `O_cert` must add per-cell embedding and collapses to
`V_cert`.

² `V_cert` dominates T2's matching coordinate but cannot lower-bound
T2 non-vacuously: T2's combinatorial output doesn't require V_cert's
algebraic content, so the ledger is "above" the task. See §"Ledger
lattice" — lower bounds, domination, and matching.

³ `F2` serves a strengthened "produce typed incidence / six-field
derivation of `M_N`" task, not the literal "output `M_N`" task.

⁴ Coarse but non-vacuous: producing any row-n value forces entering
`ℚ(cos(2π/n))`, so total work is at least `max_{n ≤ N} φ(n)/2` (the
additive `Σ φ(n)/2` form is conservative but depends on independence
assumptions that composita and field reuse make model-dependent).
Below-matching, doesn't reflect per-cell precision or root-isolation
cost, but valid as a fallback / sanity-check bound alongside
`V_cert`.

**Regime tag on the matrix.** Each "matching" judgement above is
conditional on a certification-preserving compute model. Under
unbounded-linear models, the matching of `V_cert` for T1/T3 demotes
to "above-task" per §"Matching is model-indexed" — V_cert becomes a
lower bound on a *strengthened* task that demands certificates, not
on the original T1/T3. `F2`'s matching for T2 is preserved across
regimes only when the task's output semantics require explicit
typed-incidence production: F2's robustness comes from the task spec
(unbounded-linear models do not naturally compute discrete incidence
objects), not from any intrinsic protection the lattice gives to
positional content. row-deg's coarse bound at footnote ⁴ requires the
same paid-adjunction condition as `V_cert`: "entering the row field"
is a meaningful cost only when adjunctions are paid. Under
unbounded-linear with free constants — where field elements can be
advised as precomputed values — even the row-entry argument flattens,
and the row-deg bound demotes alongside `V_cert`.

**Viable task-ledger pairings.**

- **T1 + `V_cert` + algebraic-arithmetic over ℚ.** Per-corner ordered
  enumeration with algebraic precision cost. Matching. Landfall-
  parallel.
- **T3 + `V_cert` + algebraic-arithmetic over ℚ.** Real-valued
  distinction at precision. Matching. Landfall-parallel.
- **T2 + `F2` + word-structure compute model.** Honest combinatorial
  theorem, not the original cyclotomic-depth ambition.
- **T_orbit (reformulated) + `O_cert` + lattice/rank model.**
  Path-1-flavored sibling track (per §"Compute-model / ledger
  coupling"); not literally Path 1's ψ-rank ledger.
- **T_capacity + row-field-degree + algebraic-arithmetic.** Row-level
  capacity theorem; coarse / loose.
- **(Coarse companion.) Row-field-degree on T1 / T3.** Below-matching
  fallback giving at least `max_{n ≤ N} φ(n)/2` (or sum, modulo
  composita / field-reuse independence) as a non-vacuous primitive-op
  lower bound on T1 and T3 directly. Useful as a sanity-check or
  coarse-bound companion to `V_cert`, surfaced during Q8's calibration
  attempt.

**First exit-(a) candidate for the search.** T1 or T3 (or both,
sharing `V_cert` and the same compute model) is the cleanest
committable triple if the program holds to the original
Landfall-parallel ambition. The compute-model / ledger pair is a
single commitment: algebraic-arithmetic over ℚ (or ASLP) charging
field adjunctions and ring operations, with `V_cert` as the cost
ledger.

T2 + `F2` is the alternative theorem available without further
search, at the cost of moving the program's stated ambition from
"primitive-op lower bound on cyclotomic-depth content" to "primitive-
op lower bound on typed-incidence production." Different theorem,
legitimate, but not the original target.

## What this memo is not

- **Not a proof of the driving impossibility.** The generic-rational
  placeholder construction needs explicit formalization before it becomes
  a lemma.
- **Not a compute-cost lower-bound proof.** Task + machine-model pairings
  are now proposed at §"Task-ledger admissibility" as the search's first
  exit-(a) candidate, but the proofs that those pairings deliver
  primitive-op lower bounds — the placeholder construction promoted from
  working form to theorem, plus a cost theorem connecting ledger
  components to primitive ops — remain to be done.
- **Not a commitment that a replacement ledger exists.** Exit criterion
  (b) contemplates the branch closing negative.

## Exit criteria

- **(a) Pass.** One candidate ledger passes the sensitivity criterion,
  admits a compute-model formulation, and hands off to `COUNTING-APPARATUS
  §(A)`. The memo closes; content promotes or cross-links.
- **(b) Fail.** All candidates under search fail the sensitivity criterion
  (or their apparent passes resolve to length-equivalents under closer
  reading). The compute-cost branch in `COUNTING-APPARATUS` closes negative
  with the driving impossibility promoted to a lemma statement.
