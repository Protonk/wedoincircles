# THREE-REGISTER-SYNTHESIS

Cross-source synthesis of the three iso/ briefs:
[iso/OSSERMAN-1979-BRIEF.md](iso/OSSERMAN-1979-BRIEF.md) (geometric
Bonnesen route),
[iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md](iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md) (Sobolev
stability route),
[iso/BECK-1994-BRIEF.md](iso/BECK-1994-BRIEF.md) (probabilistic
Diophantine route), with cross-brief findings consolidated in
[iso/DIDOS-PREROGATIVE.md](iso/DIDOS-PREROGATIVE.md) §"Brief findings."

**Register.** Third register per
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — *cross-source synthesis,
load-bearing, expected to hold up under scrutiny*. Each load-bearing
claim below is grounded in explicit witnesses (specific theorem
statements in the three briefs).

**Frame.** The three iso/ briefs survey three independent attacks on
the same inequality `Δ = L² − 4πA ≥ 0` (planar isoperimetric gap)
plus its higher-dimensional and Diophantine relatives. The naive
expectation is that they are alternative methods for one question,
ranked by which gives the sharpest bound. **They are not.** They are
sharp on three distinct *currencies* (rate of decay, geometric
constant, almost-every measure), with three distinct hypothesis
classes that do not nest, and three distinct L-W-safety paths to
transcendence-free re-routing. The non-interchangeability is
structural: each register is the sharp tool for its own
sub-question and a loose proxy for the others. This synthesis
articulates the structural pattern and its operational consequence
for the program.

**Methodological lineage.** This is not the program's first
multi-lens synthesis. [rotations/3DT-BRIEF.md](rotations/3DT-BRIEF.md)
is the first instance: three papers give combinatorial, algorithmic,
and geometric/lattice lenses on one theorem.
[rotations/CONTINUED-FRACTIONS-CROSSWALK.md](rotations/CONTINUED-FRACTIONS-CROSSWALK.md)
then turns the move into a primitive-substrate index, gathering six
perspectives on continued-fraction convergents. The present iso/
synthesis is the higher-resolution instance: the lenses are not three
proofs of one theorem, but three registers that are sharp on distinct
currencies of the same isoperimetric gap. The lineage now closes back
through [rotations/SIX-LENS-SYNTHESIS.md](rotations/SIX-LENS-SYNTHESIS.md),
which promotes the rotations register to the same load-bearing
standing — six lenses on the convergent substrate, sharp on different
operative aspects, organized by substitution rather than hierarchy.

## Claim 1 — Currency-by-Route Map

**Statement.** Each register is sharp on a specific currency. The
sharpness is *currency-specific*, not absolute, and the
non-interchangeability of routes is the structural consequence.

| Register | Sharp on | Loose on |
|---|---|---|
| Fourier / Sobolev (Hurwitz, Fuglede) | **rate** of `Δ_n` decay (`Θ(1/n²)` on inscribed regular `n`-gons) | constant in geometric Bonnesen form (incurs `5π` overhead) |
| Geometric / Hausdorff (Bonnesen 1924, Osserman) | **constant** (`c = 4π` provably best in `Δ ≥ 4π · d²`; equivalently `c = 1` in `(r₂ − r₁)² ≤ Δ_H/(4π)`) | rate on `n`-gon family (loose by 1–2 orders of `n`) |
| Probabilistic Diophantine (Beck, Khintchine) | **almost-every distribution** on `α`-space (Borel-Cantelli convergence-divergence threshold is sharp) | pointwise bound for *specific* `α` (specific points are measure zero) |

### 1.1 Witnesses for the Sobolev rate-sharpness

[iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md](iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md) §2.5,
specialization to inscribed regular `n`-gon:

- Actual `Δ_F = π²/(6n²) + O(1/n⁴) = Θ(1/n²)`
  (Fuglede brief eq., from Hurwitz `Δ_H,n = 4π⁴/(3n²) + O(1/n⁴)` per
  [corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md](corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md)).
- Theorem 1.2 (I.a) bound: `(1/10)(||u||² + ||∇u||²) ≤ Δ ≤ (3/5)||∇u||²`,
  with `||∇u||²₂ = Θ(1/n²)`. Both sides scale as `1/n²` —
  *bound is two-sided sharp up to constants on the regular-`n`-gon family*.
- Constants `(1/10, 3/5)` improvable to `(0.24, 0.54)` per Fuglede
  Remark 1.5 (Fuglede brief §1.2).
- Fuglede footnote 1 traces the `n_dim = 2` ancestry to Hurwitz 1902
  Fourier proof; Hurwitz Parseval identity
  `Δ_H = 4π² Σ m(m−1)|c_m|²` is exact, sharper than the Sobolev
  two-sided bound.

### 1.2 Witnesses for the geometric constant-sharpness

[iso/OSSERMAN-1979-BRIEF.md](iso/OSSERMAN-1979-BRIEF.md) §1.3
(per-inequality table) and §1.1:

- Bonnesen 1924's annulus-width form, Osserman eq. (33):
  `Δ ≥ 4π · d²`, where `d` is the minimum width of a circular
  annulus containing `C`. **Constant `4π` provably best possible**
  (Osserman p. 14: "in 1924, he obtained the constant `4π`, which he
  showed by an example was the best possible").
- Equivalently, `(r₂ − r₁)² ≤ Δ_H/(4π)` — sharp `c = 1` on the right
  side per Bonnesen [2] (Fuglede brief p. 619: "Bonnesen showed that
  the inequality ceases to hold in general if the right-hand member
  is multiplied by a constant `c < 1`").
- The geometric route's *rate* on inscribed regular `n`-gons:
  `(R − ρ)² = (1 − cos(π/n))² ~ π⁴/(4n⁴) = Θ(1/n⁴)` while
  `Δ_H ~ 4π⁴/(3n²) = Θ(1/n²)`. Bonnesen's `Δ ≥ π²(R − ρ)²` (Osserman
  eq. (21), Bonnesen 1921 [19]) gives a lower bound of `O(1/n⁴)` on
  `Δ_n` while the actual is `Θ(1/n²)` — **rate-loose by `n²`**, even
  though the constant `π²` in front is sharp.

### 1.3 Witnesses for the probabilistic almost-every-sharpness

[iso/BECK-1994-BRIEF.md](iso/BECK-1994-BRIEF.md) §1.2 (Theorem 1):

- For almost every `α ∈ R^k` with `k ≥ 2`,
  `Δ(α; N) ≪ (log N)^k · φ(log log N) ⟺ Σ 1/φ(n) < ∞` (Beck
  eq. 2.10). The `⟺` is the Borel-Cantelli convergence-divergence
  threshold; the bound is *exact* up to the `φ` choice — the
  divergence side gives matching lower bounds for infinitely many
  `N`.
- 1-dim case is Khintchine 1923/1924 (Beck eq. 1.17):
  `Δ(α; N) ≪ log N · φ(log log N) ⟺ Σ 1/φ(n) < ∞` for almost every
  `α ∈ R`. Same Borel-Cantelli sharpness.
- **Specific-`α` failure mode.** Beck p. 458: "What is missing here
  is a good lower bound for *every* `α ∈ R^k`." The almost-every
  result tells you nothing about a specific `α` outside the
  measure-1 set. For the program's target `α = π`, specific-α
  pointwise bounds require either external transcendence input or
  the empirical-to-density proxy.

### 1.4 Non-interchangeability — the operational consequence

The three sharpnesses are on *non-comparable* currencies:

- **Sobolev currency** is `||∇u||²` or `Σ |c_m|²` weighted by
  `m(m−1)` — measures the L²-mass of derivative information.
- **Geometric currency** is `(R − ρ)`, `d`, `||u||_∞` — measures the
  Hausdorff distance to a reference disk.
- **Probabilistic currency** is the Lebesgue measure on `α`-space —
  measures how typical a Diophantine property is.

Conversion between currencies is possible but lossy. The
[iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md](iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md) appendix on
the `5π` overhead documents the Sobolev-to-geometric conversion
cost explicitly: chained Sobolev embedding + Cauchy-Schwarz on
`Σ 1/k²` + `(r₂ − r₁) ≤ 2 ||u||_∞` together yield `c = 5π` in
`(r₂ − r₁)² ≤ c · Δ_H/(4π)`, *15.7× weaker* than Bonnesen's direct
`c = 1`. *Each step is sharp in its own register; the chained bound
has slack because no single extremal function realizes all three
sharpnesses simultaneously.*

**Operational consequence.** The choice of route is *currency-fit*,
not aesthetic preference. For program audit calculations:

- Need a tight constant in a Bonnesen-style geometric inequality?
  → Use Bonnesen direct (1924, sharp `c = 4π`).
- Need a tight rate of decay on inscribed regular `n`-gons?
  → Use Hurwitz / strip-`H¹` (`Θ(1/n²)`, sharp).
- Need a typical-α discrepancy estimate?
  → Use Beck / Khintchine (almost-every, with sharp Borel-Cantelli
  threshold).

The three routes are not interchangeable; the program's audit
choices respect the currency-by-route map.

## Claim 2 — L-W-Safety Content Map

**Statement.** Each register's *post-1882 calendar timestamp*
(Osserman 1979, Fuglede 1989, Beck 1994) admits a transcendence-free
re-routing path. The substrate that carries the content L-W-safely
is identifiable per register, with outstanding audit targets named.
The audit criterion is *content* not *calendar*, per
[memos/OLD-TIME-RELIGION.md](memos/OLD-TIME-RELIGION.md).

| Register | Calendar-late paper | Transcendence-free substrate | Outstanding audit target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Geometric (Osserman 1979) | survey of post-1882 Bonnesen-style | Steiner symmetrization (~1830s, pre-1882) for *qualitative* isoperimetric statement; Fejes-Tóth 1950 polygonal proof for *quantitative* `(R − ρ)²` form | Fejes-Tóth 1950 polygonal proof certification for L-W-safety |
| Sobolev (Fuglede 1989) | post-1882 spherical harmonics + Minkowski parallel bodies | Hurwitz 1902 Fourier proof (per Fuglede footnote 1, p. 619) — calendar-post-1882 but *transcendence-free in content* | **Discharged** at [iso/HURWITZ-1902-LW-AUDIT.md](iso/HURWITZ-1902-LW-AUDIT.md): proof terminates at Fourier 1822 + Parseval 1799 + Green 1828 + Cauchy 1821 / Weierstrass 1872 + complex-number algebra + Archimedean diameter ratio; no L-W / Baker / Gelfond-Schneider / Thue-Siegel-Roth content. |
| Probabilistic (Beck 1994) | post-1965 measure-theoretic Diophantine | Roth 1954 (discrepancy, L²-Fourier) + Cauchy-Schwarz + classical Fourier + Borel-Cantelli; **NOT** Roth 1955 (transcendence) | Schmidt 1960's second-moment inequality (Beck Lemma 9.71 input); cleanest single audit task |

### 2.1 Witnesses for the geometric content-path

[iso/OSSERMAN-1979-BRIEF.md](iso/OSSERMAN-1979-BRIEF.md) §"Provenance
tag for the program":

- "All quantitative Bonnesen-style strengthenings in this paper are
  post-1882" (Osserman brief §6, line ~390). Bernstein 1905 [15],
  Bonnesen 1921 [19] / 1924 [20], Hadwiger 1941 [42], Fiala 1941
  [40] — all post-L-W.
- Pre-1882 substrate: **Steiner symmetrization (~1830s)** for the
  *qualitative* isoperimetric inequality `L² ≥ 4πA`. This is the
  pre-L-W proof of the classical inequality; it does *not* recover
  the quantitative `Δ ≥ π²(R − ρ)²` strengthening, which requires
  Bonnesen-style methods.
- Quantitative substrate: **Fejes-Tóth 1950's polygonal exterior-
  parallel-curve proof** (Osserman §1.4 — the technique Osserman
  himself uses in §I.A). Fejes-Tóth's proof "drops the machinery of
  integral geometry and gives direct elementary proofs of the
  formulas needed to prove Bonnesen's inequalities" (Osserman p. 14).
  *Candidate for L-W-safety certification — but the certification is
  not in Osserman.* This is the cleanest audit task on the geometric
  side.

### 2.2 Witnesses for the Sobolev content-path

[iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md](iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md) §1.5
(technique) and §1.4 (precedents):

- Fuglede 1989's spherical-harmonics method on `Σ` is post-1882
  machinery; the Minkowski parallel-body argument is post-1882
  (Minkowski's mixed-volume inequalities, 1903).
- Fuglede footnote 1 (p. 619, quoted in Fuglede brief §1.5):
  "Still another proof — quite short — can be read off from
  Hurwitz' Fourier series proof of the isoperimetric inequality in
  the plane [8], and that leads in a certain sense to a stronger
  inequality, involving a Sobolev 1-norm of the deviation of `∂D`
  from a circle, again estimated in terms of `L² − 4πA`, see [6]."
  Reference [8] is Hurwitz 1902.
- Hurwitz 1902 itself is calendar-post-1882 by 20 years but uses no
  transcendence input. The Parseval identity
  `Δ_H = 4π² Σ m(m−1) |c_m|²` is a Hilbert-space identity on
  `L²(S¹)`, deriving only from Fourier expansion (Fourier 1822) and
  area-perimeter formulas — both pre-1882.
- The program already has the Hurwitz Parseval identity in
  [corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md](corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md), computed three
  ways for the inscribed regular `n`-gon. **The L-W-safety
  certification of the derivation is now in hand at
  [iso/HURWITZ-1902-LW-AUDIT.md](iso/HURWITZ-1902-LW-AUDIT.md):**
  the Hurwitz Parseval identity `Δ = 4π² Σ m(m − 1) |c_m|²` derives
  from Fourier 1822 + Parseval 1799 + Green 1828 + classical
  convergence machinery + complex-number algebra + the Archimedean
  diameter-to-circumference ratio, with no transcendence-theoretic
  input. The Sobolev register's audit task is discharged.

### 2.3 Witnesses for the probabilistic content-path

[iso/BECK-1994-BRIEF.md](iso/BECK-1994-BRIEF.md) §2.4 (pre-L-W
audit):

- Beck 1994's main proof uses Poisson summation (Poisson 1827, pre-
  1882), Fejér kernel smoothing (Fejér 1900, classical Fourier),
  second-moment + Cauchy-Schwarz, combinatorial box decomposition,
  and Borel-Cantelli. **None require transcendence input.**
- Critical clarification: Beck's Roth input is **Roth 1954 [17]
  "On irregularities of distribution"** (Mathematika 1, 73–79) —
  the L²-Fourier *discrepancy* lower bound. This is
  *methodologically distinct* from Roth 1955's *transcendence*
  theorem on rational approximations to algebraic numbers
  (Mathematika 2, 1–20). Same author, adjacent year, distinct
  papers. Beck cites only the 1954 paper; the 1955 transcendence
  theorem is not used.
- Schmidt 1960's second-moment inequality (Beck Lemma 9.71, citing
  ref [18]): this is the cleanest single audit point. Beck uses it
  off-the-shelf; certifying it L-W-safely would close the audit on
  Beck's content path. Schmidt 1960 is methodologically L²-Fourier
  metric Diophantine approximation — not transcendence theory — so
  the certification task is plausibly tractable, though not yet
  written.

BIND-compatibility has a worked precedent in
[rotations/3DT-BRIEF.md](rotations/3DT-BRIEF.md) §"Program-Facing
Consequences", item 2. There the allowed rotation-orbit machinery is
finite words, Burrows-Wheeler transforms, Euclidean updates, and
unimodular-lattice data, with continued fractions kept as local
arithmetic rather than the forbidden global Stern-Brocot / Farey /
Thomae / Minkowski-`?` vocabulary. Beck's probabilistic path is not the
same machinery, but its Poisson + Fejér + second-moment +
Borel-Cantelli proof inventory has the same audit shape: Fourier-
discrepancy content without transcendence input and without the erased
circle/log vocabulary. The Beck verdict is therefore audit-with-
precedent, not an isolated clearance.

### 2.4 Synthesis of the L-W-safety map

All three registers admit transcendence-free re-routing in
*content*, despite calendar-post-1882 publication. The audit work
is therefore *certification of specific proofs*, not search for
new substrate. Three concrete audit tasks:

1. **Fejes-Tóth 1950 polygonal proof** (geometric register) — verify
   the exterior-parallel-curve argument uses only pre-1882 elementary
   geometry and induction.
2. **Hurwitz 1902 Parseval derivation** (Sobolev register) — verify
   the Fourier-Parseval identity for `Δ_H` uses only Fourier 1822
   and elementary plane geometry.
3. **Schmidt 1960 second-moment inequality** (probabilistic register)
   — verify the Diophantine metric input uses only L²-Fourier and
   measure theory, no transcendence.

Each task is a candidate -BRIEF; the audit closes the L-W-safety
side of DIDOS-PREROGATIVE for the corresponding register.

**Status:** Hurwitz 1902 (task 2) is **discharged** at
[iso/HURWITZ-1902-LW-AUDIT.md](iso/HURWITZ-1902-LW-AUDIT.md). The
remaining two — Fejes-Tóth 1950 (geometric register) and Schmidt 1960
(probabilistic register) — are open. With the Sobolev register
certified, the program's principal rate-sharp content
(`Δ_n = 4π⁴/(3n²) + O(1/n⁴)` and the Parseval-form gap) sits on
certified L-W-safe substrate.

---

## Claim 3 — Hypothesis-Class Structure Across Registers

**Statement.** Each register's principal results require a
hypothesis class that does *not* nest within the others. The classes
are not ordered by inclusion; they intersect on specific test cases
(notably the inscribed regular `n`-gon, which is convex,
nearly-spherical for large `n`, and *not* in Beck's measure-1 class)
but each register has theorems that fail outside its own class. The
program needs all three classes to be available, with a *bridge* per
class for program use.

| Register | Hypothesis class | Why class is necessary | Bridge for program use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Osserman / geometric | rectifiable Jordan curves bounding plane domains; quantitative results require *convex* (or extension to non-convex via Schmidt 1939, Fiala 1941) | Bonnesen-style requires `R, ρ` well-defined; in plane only | Direct: inscribed regular `n`-gon is convex Jordan curve |
| Fuglede / Sobolev | nearly-spherical: `‖u‖_∞ ≤ 3/(20·n_dim)`, `‖∇u‖_∞ ≤ 1/2` (n_dim ≥ 3 has gradient bound implied by uniform via Lemma 2.2; for n_dim = 2 the planar constant is `3/40` and both bounds must be hypothesized) | Without the hypothesis, stability fails — *spike-on-ball counter-example* (Fuglede §1, p. 621) | Verify hypothesis: for inscribed regular `n`-gon, `‖u‖_∞ = π²/(3n²)`; uniform bound holds at polygon `n ≥ 7`, gradient bound is the binding constraint with strict satisfaction at **`n ≥ 8`** per §3.4.1 |
| Beck / probabilistic | almost-every `α ∈ R^k` for `k ≥ 2` (1-dim is Khintchine, similar class); Lemmas 4.1–4.4 specify the measure-1 set | Specific `α` is measure zero; the Borel-Cantelli machinery is intrinsically about a measure-1 conclusion | Empirical-to-density proxy ([memos/KRAFT-BUDGET-ONE-DIMENSIONAL.md](memos/KRAFT-BUDGET-ONE-DIMENSIONAL.md) Step 5) bridges almost-every to specific α via averaged-over-range |

### 3.1 Witnesses for hypothesis precision

**Osserman / geometric** — [iso/OSSERMAN-1979-BRIEF.md](iso/OSSERMAN-1979-BRIEF.md):

- Theorem 1 hypothesis: "Let `D` be a plane domain bounded by a
  rectifiable Jordan curve of length `L`. `A`, `ρ`, `R` denote the
  area, inradius, and circumradius of `D`" (Osserman p. 3).
- All quantitative inequalities (11)–(23) in Theorems 2–4 require
  rectifiability; convexity is assumed for the simplest proofs and
  extended to non-convex via Schmidt 1939 [68] / Fiala 1941 [40] /
  Hadwiger 1941 [41].
- **Plane-only.** Higher-dimensional Bonnesen analogs in Osserman §I.B
  require additional hypotheses (Gauss curvature bounded above by
  `M`); these are different theorems, not direct generalizations.

**Fuglede / Sobolev** —
[iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md](iso/FUGLEDE-1989-BRIEF.md) §1.1:

- "Nearly-spherical hypothesis" (Definition 1.1): `‖u‖_∞ ≤ a := 3/(20·n_dim)`,
  `‖∇u‖_∞ ≤ 1/2` (Fuglede's `n_dim` is *ambient dimension*, not polygon
  vertex count — the namespace collision was the source of the original
  arithmetic error fixed in §3.4.1). For `n_dim ≥ 3` the gradient bound
  follows from the uniform bound (Lemma 2.2). For `n_dim = 2` (where the
  program lives) both must be hypothesized; the planar uniform-bound
  constant is `a = 3/40`.
- **Necessity of the hypothesis.** Fuglede §1 opener (p. 621), in
  Fuglede brief §1.4: "*it was shown that some restriction like (\*)
  above is necessary for stability — whether in uniform norm or in
  Sobolev 1-norm as in (I.a). (An example is obtained e.g. by adding
  a thin 'spike' to a ball.)*" The spike-on-ball construction has
  small `Δ` but large `‖u‖_∞` — defeating any L^∞ stability without
  a nearly-spherical pre-hypothesis. The Sobolev stability fails for
  the same reason.
- For inscribed regular `n`-gon (Fuglede brief §2.2):
  `‖u‖_∞ = π²/(3n²) + O(1/n⁴)`. With `n_dim = 2`, the planar
  uniform-bound hypothesis `‖u‖_∞ ≤ 3/40` becomes
  `π²/(3n²) ≤ 3/40`, i.e., `n² ≥ 40π²/9 ≈ 43.86`, so the uniform
  bound holds at polygon `n ≥ 7`. The gradient bound
  `‖∇u‖_∞ ≤ 1/2` is the binding constraint and fails marginally at
  `n = 7` (≈ 0.516 vs `1/2`), holding strictly from `n ≥ 8` onward.
  **Strict nearly-spherical admission for the inscribed regular
  `n`-gon: `n ≥ 8`** per the corrected computation in §3.4.1. (The
  original `n ≥ 22` figure in this paragraph was an arithmetic
  mis-substitution of polygon-`n` into Fuglede's `3/(20·n_dim)`
  constant, off by a factor of `~3` — fixed at §3.4.1 with the
  small-`n` coverage worked out at §3.4.2 / §3.4.5.) For
  `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` (where the hypothesis fails strictly), Fuglede's
  general theorems do not apply; the program covers these via
  per-`n` direct Hurwitz Parseval computation as documented in
  §3.4.2 and verified at §3.4.5, where Bridge 1's per-`n` direct
  ratios confirm Theorem 1.2 (I.a)'s *conclusion* holds across the
  full `n ≥ 3` family even where its hypothesis does not.

**Beck / probabilistic** —
[iso/BECK-1994-BRIEF.md](iso/BECK-1994-BRIEF.md) §1.2:

- Theorem 1 hypothesis: "for almost every `α ∈ R^k`" with `k ≥ 2`.
- Lemmas 4.1–4.4 (Beck §4) specify the measure-1 set explicitly:
  Lemma 4.1 controls a sum of large terms in the Fourier expansion,
  Lemma 4.2 supplies a Khintchine-style local criterion, Lemma 4.3
  is a divergence Borel-Cantelli for `nα`, Lemma 4.4 gives a series
  convergence on a weighted lattice sum. The intersection of the
  Lemma 4.1–4.4 hypotheses defines Theorem 1's measure-1 class.
- **Specific-α failure mode.** Per Beck brief §2.3: "Beck's headline
  theorems are measure-theoretic; the program targets a specific α
  (= π). Specific points are measure zero; the theorem says nothing
  about specific α." This is the intrinsic limit of the
  probabilistic class.

### 3.2 Why the classes do not nest

Three pairwise non-inclusions:

- **Osserman ⊄ Fuglede.** Osserman's class includes far-from-spherical
  convex curves (e.g., a thin ellipse with eccentricity → 1) which
  fail Fuglede's `‖u‖_∞ ≤ 3/(20·n_dim)` hypothesis. Fuglede stability
  fails on such curves; Bonnesen `Δ ≥ π²(R − ρ)²` still holds.
- **Fuglede ⊄ convex-Osserman (Bonnesen subclass).** Fuglede's class
  includes non-convex nearly-spherical domains (small spike included,
  since spike-on-ball with small enough spike still satisfies the
  nearly-spherical condition). Osserman's *quantitative* theorems —
  including Bonnesen's `Δ ≥ π²(R − ρ)²` strengthening — require
  convexity directly. Fuglede's class is *contained* in Osserman's
  broad rectifiable-Jordan-curve register; the non-inclusion is
  strictly against the convex sub-register where the quantitative
  Bonnesen form lives. (Extension to non-convex via Schmidt 1939,
  Fiala 1941 is a separate theorem.)
- **Beck ⊄ {Osserman ∪ Fuglede}.** Beck's measure-1 class lives in
  `α`-parameter space, not curve-shape space. There is no embedding
  of Beck's hypothesis class into the geometric or Sobolev classes;
  they are about different objects (sequences vs. curves). This
  non-inclusion is *categorial* — at the level of input type — not
  a numerical comparison.

The classes intersect on specific test cases. The **inscribed regular
`n`-gon** is in:

- Osserman's class (convex Jordan curve in plane), for all `n ≥ 3`.
- Fuglede's class (nearly-spherical), for `n ≥ 8` per §3.4 (corrected from the original §3.1 claim of `n ≥ 22`, which was the namespace-collision error).
- *Not* directly in Beck's class — the polygon-vertex sequence
  `(k/n) mod 1` for `k = 0, …, n−1` is rational with discrepancy
  exactly `1/n`, not an irrational Kronecker sequence. Beck enters
  the program via the *adjacent* sequence `(n π) mod 1`, which is
  the K-H-L-A target, not the polygon vertex sequence.

So even on the program's central test case, the three registers
attach to *different objects*: Osserman/Fuglede attach to the
polygon as a curve; Beck attaches to a Diophantine sequence
elsewhere in the K-H-L-A apparatus.

#### 3.2.1 Numerical witness verification

The first two pairwise non-inclusions have been verified by direct
construction in
[corners/pairwise_non_inclusion_witnesses.sage](corners/pairwise_non_inclusion_witnesses.sage):

- **Osserman ⊄ Fuglede** via thin ellipse `(a = 2, b = 1/2)`, area
  exactly `π` (no rescaling). Bonnesen lower bound `π²(R − ρ)² ≈
  22.21`; actual `Δ_H ≈ 34.11` (Osserman slack: `+53.6 %`).
  `‖u‖_∞ = 1.0` vs Fuglede bound `0.075` (Fuglede excess: `+1233 %`).
- **Fuglede ⊄ convex-Osserman** via small-spike non-convex
  `r(θ) = 1 + ε cos(k θ)` with `k = 5`, `ε = 0.0575`. After
  volume-normalization: `‖u‖_∞ ≈ 0.058` (Fuglede margin: `+22.3 %`),
  `‖∇u‖_∞ ≈ 0.287` (Fuglede margin: `+42.6 %`), `κ_dip ≈ −0.558`
  (non-convex; threshold margin `+43.75 %`). All three audit margins
  exceed `+10 %`.

Witness 3 (Beck) is categorial — type-signature non-comparability —
and has no numerical witness; the prose argument carries the claim.

Script audited per Q34: `elliptic_ec` perimeter convention checked
against direct integration to `2.5 × 10⁻¹⁵`; polar-curvature formula
sign convention verified; volume normalization verified to give
exactly `A = π`.

### 3.3 Bridges per register

For each register, a bridge is needed to apply the register's
results to specific program targets:

- **Osserman → program**: direct, no bridge needed. Inscribed regular
  `n`-gon is a convex Jordan curve; Bonnesen-style inequalities apply
  pointwise. Loseness on rate is the price; the bound *holds*, just
  loosely.
- **Fuglede → program**: hypothesis verification. For `n ≥ 8` the
  inscribed regular `n`-gon is nearly-spherical (in the strict
  Fuglede sense, both bounds in (*) holding); see §3.4 for the
  computation. Theorems 1.2 / 2.3 apply pointwise in that range
  with rate-sharp Sobolev bound. For `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` the
  hypothesis fails strictly; coverage there comes from elsewhere
  in the iso/ apparatus (per §3.4 below). *Bridge: explicit
  threshold `n ≥ 8` for hypothesis admission, with §3.4 documenting
  small-n coverage from other repo apparatus*.
- **Beck → program**: empirical-to-density proxy
  ([memos/KRAFT-BUDGET-ONE-DIMENSIONAL.md](memos/KRAFT-BUDGET-ONE-DIMENSIONAL.md)
  Step 5). Beck's almost-every statements do not certify pointwise
  for `α = π`; the proxy replaces pointwise discrepancy with
  averaged-over-range discrepancy, which is a different quantity for
  which almost-every-style results admit honest interpretation. The
  proxy is the program's bridge from Beck's measure-theoretic
  register to specific-α program targets. *Bridge: empirical-to-
  density proxy, currently a hypothesis at KRAFT-BUDGET-ONE-DIMENSIONAL
  Step 5*.

### 3.4 Coverage of the small-`n` regime

The `n ≥ 22` figure originally given in §3.1 is **wrong**. The error
is an arithmetic mis-substitution: Fuglede's hypothesis (\*) uses
his `n` for *ambient dimension*, not polygon vertex count. For
n_dim = 2, the constant is fixed at `a = 3/(20 · 2) = 3/40`, not
`3/(20·polygon_n)`. Correcting:

#### 3.4.1 Corrected threshold for nearly-spherical admission

For inscribed regular `n`-gon (polygon vertex count = `n`) after
Fuglede normalization (volume = `π`, barycentre = 0):

- **Uniform bound:** `||u||_∞ = π²/(3n²) + O(1/n⁴)`. The hypothesis
  `||u||_∞ ≤ 3/40` becomes `π²/(3n²) ≤ 3/40 ⟺ n² ≥ 40π²/9 ≈ 43.86 ⟺
  n ≥ 7`. (n=6: 0.0914 > 0.075 ✗; n=7: 0.0671 < 0.075 ✓.)
- **Gradient bound:** `||∇u||_∞ = √(π/A_n) · tan(π/n)`. The
  hypothesis `||∇u||_∞ ≤ 1/2` is checked numerically:

  | n | √(π/A_n) | tan(π/n) | ‖∇u‖_∞ | ≤ 1/2? |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 3 | 1.555 | 1.732 | 2.694 | ✗ |
  | 4 | 1.253 | 1.000 | 1.253 | ✗ |
  | 5 | 1.149 | 0.7265 | 0.835 | ✗ |
  | 6 | 1.099 | 0.5774 | 0.635 | ✗ |
  | 7 | 1.0715 | 0.4816 | 0.516 | ✗ (just over) |
  | 8 | 1.0539 | 0.4142 | 0.437 | ✓ |

So **strict satisfaction of Fuglede's nearly-spherical hypothesis
holds for `n ≥ 8`**, not `n ≥ 22`. The `n = 7` case fails the
gradient bound by `≈ 3%`. The truly-uncovered Fuglede range is
`n ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` — five cases including the program's
load-bearing **first-cubic** case `n = 7` (Gauss-Wantzel).

This is a substantive correction to §3.1 / §3.3; the original
threshold was off by a factor of ~3.

#### 3.4.2 Coverage of `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` from existing repo apparatus

For each of the five small cases, the program already has the
following data:

- **Exact value of `Δ_n`** via the elementary closed form
  `Δ_n = L_n²[1 − (π/n) cot(π/n)]` with `L_n = 2n sin(π/n)`,
  computed to machine precision for `n ∈ [3, 100]` in
  [corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md](corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md).
- **Hurwitz Parseval coefficients** `c_m^{(n)} = L_n²/(4π² m²)`
  for `m = 1 + jn`, `j ∈ Z`, zero elsewhere. Per
  [corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md](corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md), the Parseval
  identity `Δ_n = 4π² Σ m(m−1) |c_m^{(n)}|²` is **exact**, with no
  hypothesis on small-deviation or convex-near-disk. So Sobolev
  information `||u'||²` at any specific `n` is computable directly
  from these coefficients without any nearly-spherical assumption.
- **Bonnesen lower bound** `Δ_n ≥ π²(R − ρ)²` (Osserman eq. (21))
  applies for all `n ≥ 3`, since the inscribed regular `n`-gon is
  a convex Jordan curve. The bound is loose (rate `O(1/n⁴)` versus
  actual `Θ(1/n²)`, per the cross-brief pattern in
  [iso/DIDOS-PREROGATIVE.md](iso/DIDOS-PREROGATIVE.md)) but **valid
  pointwise** at every specific `n`. Tabulating:

  | n | R | ρ | (R−ρ) | π²(R−ρ)² | Δ_n (actual) | ratio |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 3 | 1 | 0.500 | 0.500 | 2.467 | 10.683 | 4.33 |
  | 4 | 1 | 0.7071 | 0.293 | 0.846 | 4.566 | 5.40 |
  | 5 | 1 | 0.8090 | 0.191 | 0.360 | 1.832 | 5.09 |
  | 6 | 1 | 0.8660 | 0.134 | 0.177 | 0.881 | 4.98 |
  | 7 | 1 | 0.9009 | 0.0991 | 0.0969 | 0.4634 | 4.78 |

  (Ratio ≈ 5 throughout; the asymptotic `n²` slack is bounded by a
  finite factor in the small-n regime.) **Bonnesen lower bound is
  pointwise valid for every `n ≥ 3`**, including all five
  uncovered cases.

So coverage status for `n ∈ {3, …, 7}`:

- ✓ *Exact value of `Δ_n`*: covered by elementary closed form.
- ✓ *Bonnesen lower bound*: covered by Osserman eq. (21) pointwise.
- ✓ *Hurwitz Parseval Sobolev information*: covered by direct
  Fourier-coefficient computation, no hypothesis required.
- ✗ *Fuglede's general two-sided Sobolev bound
  `(1/10)(‖u‖² + ‖∇u‖²) ≤ Δ ≤ (3/5)‖∇u‖²` with explicit constants*:
  not covered. The constants `(1/10, 3/5)` are derived under the
  nearly-spherical hypothesis; for `n ≤ 7` the constants would
  need to be re-derived per `n` (or a polygon-tailored hypothesis
  installed).

The single piece **not** in the existing apparatus for the small-`n`
regime is the *general* two-sided Sobolev stability with explicit
universal constants. Direct per-`n` computation supplies the
Sobolev information, but not in a single uniform-in-`n` constant.

#### 3.4.3 Bridge candidates for the missing piece, ranked by cost

The missing piece is: an explicit two-sided Sobolev bound for
`n ∈ {3, …, 7}` with constants the program can quote. Candidates:

1. **Per-n direct Parseval computation.** *Cheapest.* For each
   `n ∈ {3, …, 7}`, compute `||u||²₂`, `||∇u||²₂`, and the ratio
   `(||u||² + ||∇u||²)/Δ` from the Hurwitz coefficients
   `c_m^{(n)} = L_n²/(4π² m²) · 1[m ≡ 1 (mod n)]`. The result is
   five explicit ratios, each a finite rational expression in
   `cos(π/n)` and `sin(π/n)`. Five computations, each closed-form,
   each L-W-safe (no hypothesis on small deviation). The
   "constant" replacing Fuglede's `(1/10, 3/5)` is the supremum of
   the ratios over `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` — a finite, explicitly
   computable number. **Cost: low; uses existing repo machinery.**

2. **Tabulation of existing data.** *Zero new computation.* Compile
   from
   [corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md](corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md) and the
   elementary closed forms a table of `(Δ_n, ||u||_∞, R-ρ,
   Bonnesen-bound)` for `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` — pure bookkeeping. Does
   not supply a Sobolev stability constant but documents the
   coverage status precisely. **Cost: zero new math.** This brief
   already does most of it (table in §3.4.2).

3. **Acknowledge case as outside Fuglede's reach.** *Zero-cost
   honesty.* Document that Fuglede's general theorem does not
   apply at `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` and that per-`n` direct Parseval is
   the operational substitute. The audit then says: "for `n ≥ 8`
   use Fuglede; for `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` use direct Parseval per §3.4.2."
   Two routes for one register, partitioned by `n`. **Cost: zero;
   already implicit in the cross-brief findings.**

4. **Polygon-tailored stability theorem.** *Higher-cost; new math.*
   Prove a Sobolev stability bound specific to convex polygons
   (where the spike-on-ball obstruction does not apply, since
   convex polygons cannot have spikes). A statement of the form
   "for any convex `n`-gon with `n ≥ 3`, `(c_1)(||u||² +
   ||∇u||²) ≤ Δ ≤ c_2 ||∇u||²` with explicit `c_1, c_2`" would
   close the gap uniformly. Cost: requires showing the constants
   `c_1, c_2` are bounded uniformly over convex polygons (likely
   true by compactness in the convex-polygon parameter space, but
   not in this paper or the briefs). **Cost: medium; requires new
   theorem-proving.**

5. **Beck on fixed-`n` discrete distributions.** *Not applicable.*
   Beck's framework is for almost-every irrational `α` in `(nα)
   mod 1` Kronecker sequences. The polygon vertex sequence
   `(k/n) mod 1` for `k = 0, …, n-1` is rational and finite —
   discrepancy `1/n` exactly, by direct counting. Beck supplies
   nothing. **Cost: not applicable.**

#### 3.4.4 Updated bridge statement for Fuglede → program

Combining §3.4.1–3.4.3, the corrected bridge for the Fuglede
register is:

> **For `n ≥ 8`**, the inscribed regular `n`-gon is strictly
> nearly-spherical (both bounds in (*) hold) and Fuglede Theorems
> 1.2, 2.3 apply pointwise with the explicit constants
> `(1/10, 3/5)` improvable to `(0.24, 0.54)` per Remark 1.5.
> **For `n ∈ {3, …, 7}`**, Fuglede's general theorems do not
> apply, but the program already has all the operationally
> relevant content: exact `Δ_n` from the elementary closed form,
> Sobolev seminorms from the Hurwitz Parseval coefficients
> directly, and the Bonnesen lower bound from Osserman eq. (21).
> The cheapest formal bridge for an explicit two-sided Sobolev
> stability constant in this range is **per-`n` direct Parseval
> computation** (candidate 1 above), using the existing Hurwitz
> coefficient formulas. The truly-load-bearing first-cubic case
> `n = 7` falls in this range and is reachable without Fuglede.

The program's small-`n` cases are therefore *not* outside iso/'s
reach; they are inside via the **Hurwitz-Parseval direct route**,
which the program already operates on
[corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md](corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md). Fuglede 1989
adds value at `n ≥ 8` by supplying explicit uniform-in-n
constants; at `n ≤ 7` the per-n computation is available and
gives explicit per-n constants. The synthesis's claim that
"Beck enters the program via the K-H-L-A discrepancy branch, not
via the polygon vertices" (§3.2) is reaffirmed: at small `n`,
the Hurwitz Parseval / strip-`H¹` route is the program's
operational substrate, and the Fuglede `n ≥ 8` threshold simply
documents where Fuglede 1989 starts adding marginal value over
the program's existing apparatus.

#### 3.4.5 Bridge 1 executed: per-`n` direct Sobolev ratios

Bridge 1 (per-`n` direct Parseval/wedge computation) has been carried
out in
[corners/fuglede_ratio_small_n.sage](corners/fuglede_ratio_small_n.sage).
Computed ratios `Δ_F / (||u||² + ||∇u||²)` at `n ∈ {3, …, 12}`
(200-bit precision; truncated for display):

| n     | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|
| ratio | 0.2739 | 0.3729 | 0.4184 | 0.4432 | 0.4582 | 0.4680 | 0.4747 | 0.4795 | 0.4830 | 0.4857 |

All ten ratios exceed Fuglede's universal `1/10`. The infimum over
the small-`n` range `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` (hypothesis (*) formally fails)
is `≈ 0.274` at `n = 3` — a margin of `≈ 174 %` over `1/10`.
Ratios increase monotonically toward `≈ 0.5`, matching the
leading-order asymptotic `(π²/(6 n²)) / (π²/(3 n²)) = 1/2` (since
`Δ_F ∼ π²/(6 n²)` and `‖∇u‖² ∼ π²/(3 n²)` dominate `‖u‖² ∼ π⁴/(45 n⁴)`).

**Lower-bound verdict.** Fuglede's lower bound
`(1/10)(‖u‖² + ‖∇u‖²) ≤ Δ_F` holds at every inscribed regular
`n`-gon with `n ≥ 3` by direct Parseval verification — including at
`n ∈ {3, …, 7}` where hypothesis (*) formally fails. The bound's
*conclusion* holds on the full polygon family even where the bound's
*hypothesis* does not; this gap between hypothesis-satisfaction and
conclusion-holding is program intelligence about how loose Fuglede's
universal `1/10` is on this specific family.

**Upper-bound verdict.** Fuglede's upper bound
`Δ_F ≤ (3/5)‖∇u‖²` also holds at every `n ∈ {3, …, 12}` by direct
verification. Sup of `Δ_F / ‖∇u‖²` over `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` is
`≈ 0.4640` at `n = 7` — a slack of `≈ 22.7 %` under the universal
`3/5 = 0.6`. The improved Remark 1.5 constant `0.54` is closer to
the actual asymptotic `0.5`, but the universal `3/5` holds with
comfortable margin across the polygon family.

Together these certify the **full two-sided Theorem 1.2 (I.a)** on
the inscribed regular `n`-gon family for `n ≥ 3`, even where
hypothesis (*) fails. The bound's hypothesis is sufficient for the
conclusion, not necessary; on this specific structured family the
conclusion holds well beyond the hypothesis's strict reach.

Script audited per Q33: math verified, `Δ_F` cross-checked against
Hurwitz `Δ_H = L² − 4πA` to residual `~ 10⁻²⁴`, hypothesis flags
match the corrected threshold table in §3.4.1.

## Synthesis: Three Registers, Three Sub-Questions

The three registers are sharp on three different currencies because
they are answering three different *questions*:

- **Geometric register asks:** *"How close is this fixed convex curve
  to a disk in Hausdorff metric?"* Answer: bounded by `(Δ_H/(4π))^{1/2}`
  with sharp constant `1` (Bonnesen 1924). Sharp on the
  curve-to-disk Hausdorff distance.
- **Sobolev register asks:** *"How concentrated is the Fourier mass
  of this nearly-spherical domain on the m=1 mode?"* Answer:
  `Δ_F = (κ_n + O(small)) (‖u‖² + ‖∇u‖²)` with explicit constants
  `κ_n` (Fuglede 1989). Sharp on the H¹ Sobolev mass.
- **Probabilistic register asks:** *"For a typical irrational `α`,
  how uniformly distributed is `(nα) mod 1`?"* Answer:
  `Δ(α; N) ≪ (log N)^k φ(log log N) ⟺ Σ 1/φ(n) < ∞` (Beck 1994).
  Sharp on the typical-α discrepancy threshold.

These are *distinct questions*. None is a special case of another.
The *non-interchangeability of routes* is therefore not a defect of
the registers but a reflection of the question-multiplicity. The
program's audit choices respect the question-by-currency map: which
route to use depends on which sub-question is being asked.

The K-H-L-A endgame
([memos/KRAFT-HERMITE-LINDEMANN-AITCHISON.md](memos/KRAFT-HERMITE-LINDEMANN-AITCHISON.md))
is a multi-step argument that touches all three sub-questions:

- The *isoperimetric gap* on inscribed regular `n`-gons is in the
  geometric / Sobolev class. The Hurwitz/strip-`H¹` route is sharp
  on the rate `Θ(1/n²)` (program already has this).
- The *constant* in the discrepancy-to-gap conversion is in the
  geometric class. Bonnesen 1924's sharp `c = 1` is the operational
  reference.
- The *discrepancy of `(n π) mod 1`* is in the probabilistic class
  (or its specific-α specialization via the empirical-to-density
  proxy). Beck's machinery is the methodological exemplar.

The synthesis is therefore not a unification — it is a *map* that
tells the program which register to use for which step. Different
currencies, different L-W-safety paths, different hypothesis classes,
different bridges. The audit is currency-fit, route-by-step.

---

## Closing — Operational Implications for the Program

This synthesis establishes three load-bearing facts the program now
inherits:

1. **Currency-by-route map.** The choice of route for a specific
   audit step is determined by which currency must be sharp.
   Geometric for constants; Sobolev for rates; probabilistic for
   typical-α distributions. Mixing routes incurs conversion overhead
   (the `5π` overhead being the documented case) and should be
   justified case-by-case.
2. **L-W-safety content map.** All three registers admit
   transcendence-free re-routing; the audit work is certification of
   specific proofs, not new mathematics. Three audit tasks named:
   Fejes-Tóth 1950 (geometric), Hurwitz 1902 Parseval (Sobolev),
   Schmidt 1960 second-moment (probabilistic). Each is a candidate
   future -BRIEF.
3. **Hypothesis-class structure.** No nesting; bridges per register.
   Inscribed regular `n`-gon is in Osserman class (pointwise, all
   `n ≥ 3`), in Fuglede class strictly for `n ≥ 8` (per the
   corrected threshold computation in §3.4.1; the synthesis's
   original `n ≥ 22` was an arithmetic error mis-substituting
   polygon-`n` into Fuglede's `3/(20·n_dim)` constant), and not
   in Beck's class (which targets `(nα) mod 1`, not the polygon
   vertices). Program use of Beck requires the empirical-to-density
   proxy. For Fuglede's small-`n` cases `n ∈ {3, …, 7}` —
   including the load-bearing first-cubic `n = 7` — the program's
   coverage comes from per-`n` direct Hurwitz Parseval computation
   on
   [corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md](corners/HURWITZ-GAP.md)'s coefficient
   formulas, not from Fuglede's general theorem. Fuglede 1989 adds
   marginal value over the existing apparatus only at `n ≥ 8`.

The program does not need to choose one register; it needs to use
each at its sharp currency, with the bridges and audit tasks
acknowledged. This synthesis is the operational map.

- The currency-by-route map (Claim 1) and its operational consequence
  for audit step selection.
- The L-W-safety content map (Claim 2) and the three named outstanding
  audit tasks.
- The hypothesis-class structure (Claim 3) and the per-register
  bridges, including the explicit `n ≥ 8` threshold for Fuglede on
  inscribed regular `n`-gons (corrected from the original `n ≥ 22`
  arithmetic mis-substitution per §3.4.1) and the empirical-to-density
  proxy as the Beck bridge.
- The synthesis claim that the three registers answer three distinct
  sub-questions, hence the non-interchangeability is structural not
  defective.

This memo should NOT be cited for:

- Any new isoperimetric or discrepancy theorem; the synthesis
  contains no new mathematics, only a reading of the three iso/
